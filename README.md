Laxe
===

## What

**Laxe** is a simple to use library for any website, using js!
It does what it does and nothing more. The one concern of **Laxe** is, parallaxify a website! 
Yes, any website, even yours!

It's as simple as adding one line of code, which is exactly what you're going to have to do, but more about that in the next section.

## How

 - First, npm this module using: `npm i -S laxe`. Easy, right? Well, not for the hardest part.

 - Add a couple of classes, e.g. `laxe`, to some of your elements on the desired website. Remember the name!

 - Lastly, Add this line `const laxers = new Laxe('.laxe')`, remember to use the class you added earlier.
And bam! Done! Easy right?

Well, that was boring, how a bout some customization?

Just as easy as step two. Add some data-attributes. Uoi can use 

 - `data-speed`: any number decimal or not.
 - `data-axis`: can be `x`, `y` or anything else for both.

Doot. That's it!

# Why

Just because the net needs more libraries.
